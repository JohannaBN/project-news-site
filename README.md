## The problem

Started by making a rough sketch on paper to get the main structure. After that I started buildning from the top and worked my way down with html and css. I created segment or areas using Flexbox and CSS Grid that I filled with content.

I ended with making the content responsive. With this project I stared by coding for desktop - next time I will try to code it mobile first.

If I had more time I would try to change the links in the navigation bar to icons instead of text.
